Story
This project is designed to address the challenges posed by the digital divide, particularly focusing on the populations most affected by this issue. By referencing the updates made in the Digital Equity Act of 2021, our project introduces an enhanced Digital Divide Index (DDI) to better assess and allocate resources where they are most needed. The revision in the project takes into account the new definition of 'covered populations' provided by the act, reflecting our commitment to adapting our analysis to the most current legislative framework and stakeholder feedback.

Approach

Our project is rooted in a comprehensive approach that spans data collection, analysis, visualization, and dissemination. We plan to gather pertinent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the FCC National Broadband Map, which will serve as the foundation for our analysis. The DDI will be calculated in line with the methodology established by Purdue University, yet our application will incorporate adjustments to account for the most recent updates and criteria. Visualization of the DDI using Python and GeoPandas is aimed at providing clear, actionable insights through spatial representation, making the data accessible and meaningful. The culmination of our efforts will be the update and launch of a dedicated section on a GitHub Pages website, ensuring that our findings reach a broad audience.

Risks

Anticipated challenges include the potential lack of updated rural population data, which could impact the depth of our analysis, and the necessity to adapt the DDI calculation method to integrate new or different factors.

Unique Contribution

Our project's unique contribution lies in its timely response to legislative changes and stakeholder needs. By updating both the underlying data and the analytical model of the DDI, we will provide an essential tool for decision-makers and advocates working to bridge the digital divide. The insights generated from our work will directly inform resource allocation and policy development, reflecting the dynamic nature of technology and society.
