# 2022 Digital Divide Index
In this project, we calculated 2022 Digital Divide Index for Maine and visualized DDI based on the newly defined "covered populations" in the [Digital Equity Act of 2021](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/community-resilience-estimates/partnerships/ntia/digital-equity.html). 

The Digital Divide Index consists of two scores, the infrastructure/adoption (INFA) score and the socioeconomic (SE) score. 

**Note**: area and census tract are used interchangably in this result reprot. 

## Result

### DDI part
According to [2022 Digital Divide Index (DDI)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8ad45c48ba5c43d8ad36240ff0ea0dc7) posted by Purdue University, the DDI score measures physical access/adoption and socioeconomic characteristics that may limit motivation, skills, and usage. A higher DDI indicates a higher digital divide.

Below are the top 5 areas with the highest DDI scores. 
```
              id  DDI_scaled
0    23001010100  100.000000
14   23001020402   93.863754
8    23001020100   90.144678
189  23011021000   84.787493
327  23027046002   84.110428
```
- Most of the ids are shown in the top 5 areas with the highest INFA scores. However, only one of the ids is shown in the top 5 areas with the highest SE scores. 

Below is the map illustrating DDI scores.

### INFA part
The INFA score consists of four variables related to broadband infrastructure and adoption. 

The four variables includes:
- percent of homes without a computing device (desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.)
- percent of homes with no internet access (have no internet subscription, including cellular data plans or dial-up)
- average download
- average upload speeds in Megabits per second (Mbps) weighted by number of speed tests based Ookla SpeedtestÂ® open dataset

Below are the top 5 areas with the highest INFA scores. 
```
              id  INFA_scaled
0    23001010100   100.000000
359  23027046002    95.514704
221  23011021000    89.753659
86   23003952700    86.056359
16   23001020100    85.309379
```
- None of these ids is shown in the top 5 areas with the highest SE scores. It seems that SE score distribution and INFA score distribution might be very different. To verify our assumption, we can compare the INFA map and SE map.

Below is the INFA score map. 
<img src='../figs/INFA_scaled_tract.png'>

- In this figure, areas with red color have higher INFA scores while areas with green color have lower INFA scores. A higher INFA score indicates that more broadband infrastructure need to be improved. 
- Areas close to the coast have relatively lower INFA scores. 


### SE part
The SE score consists of eight variables that are the percentages of eight "covered populations" defined in the Digital Equity Act of 2021.

The eight "covered populations" includes:
- Persons who are 60 years of age or older;
- Incarcerated individuals;
- Veterans;
- Persons with disabilities;
- Members of a racial or ethnic minority group;
- Rural residents;
- Individuals with a language barrier, including those who are English learners or have low literacy levels;
- Individuals living in households with incomes not exceeding 150 percent of the poverty level.

## Furthur Analysis

### Visualization
- DDI vs. INFA vs. SE
     - The DDI map and INFA map have more similar distributions. 
- Eight Covered populations
     - 

### Top N area list comparison
Based on the observation of the top 5 areas lists, we saw some areas shown in several lists. Therefore, we planed to analyze the overlapping parts in the lists. 

To check the result of the analysis, the following commanded is executed.
```
make SE_analysis
```

The command prints out the overlapping parts in the lists when the number of overlapping elements is greater than half of the length of the list. 
```
Top 5 Comparison
------------------------------------------
3 common locations between Incarcerated and Language

Top 10 Comparison
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Incarcerated and Language
------------------------------------------
5 common locations between Disabled and Poverty

Top 20 Comparison
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Over 60 and Incarcerated
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Over 60 and Veterans
------------------------------------------
11 common locations between Over 60 and Language
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Incarcerated and Rural
------------------------------------------
17 common locations between Incarcerated and Language
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Disabled and Poverty
------------------------------------------
10 common locations between Rural and Language

Top 50 Comparison
------------------------------------------
28 common locations between Over 60 and Incarcerated
------------------------------------------
28 common locations between Over 60 and Veterans
------------------------------------------
26 common locations between Over 60 and Rural
------------------------------------------
30 common locations between Over 60 and Language
------------------------------------------
30 common locations between Incarcerated and Rural
------------------------------------------
42 common locations between Incarcerated and Language
------------------------------------------
26 common locations between Disabled and Poverty
------------------------------------------
27 common locations between Rural and Language
```

- The common locations between Incarcerated and Language are shown in top 5/10/20/50 list comparisons. The major reason might be that we used the same technique to estimate incarcerated populations and language barrier populations.
- The pair `Disabled and Poverty` is shown in top 10/20/50 list comparisons. 

### DDI

## Next Step
- Based on the overlap, we can furthur analyze the most affected areas and potential correlations between eight covered populations. 
- To ensure that the fund and resource are allocated effectively, it's important to understand the specific issue in each area. For example, a high SE score doesn't tell us what kind of help is more important in this area.
